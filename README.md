# Brain-MRI-segmentation-using-Dilated-U-Net
The project involved using Brain MRI images (sourced from the BRATS2020 dataset) to segement parts of the image as tumorous and non-tumorous. A modified version of the U-Net model has been used, where certain CNN layers in the model are replaced with dilated CNN layers for better feature capturing.
